Project Title:CREATE A BAR CHART OR HSTOGRAM TO VISUALISE THE DISTRIBUTUION OF A CATEGORICAL OR CONTINOUS VARIABLE SUCH AS DISTRIBUTION OF AGES OR GENDER IN A POPULATIONS WITH THE DATASET.

Project Description: Visualization is a crucial step in data analysis to understand the distribution and patterns within the data. In this guide, we will demonstrate how to visualize the distribution of ages (continuous variable) and gender (categorical variable).

Technologies Used:Python 3.x,Pandas,Matplotlib.

How to Run: 1.Clone the repository. 2.Navigate to the project directory 3.Ensure you have the required packages installed. 4.Place your dataset in the project directory. 5.Run the Python script.

Output: 1.Gender Distribution Bar Chart: The bar chart shows the count of each gender in the dataset. 2.Age Distribution Histogram: The histogram shows the frequency distribution of ages in the dataset.
